new operation variables:
	SPLIT_SIZE
		number of features in one sublattice
		default 10?
	MAX_SPLIT
		max number of sublattices to use during the split
		set to -1 for no limit
when classifier is called:
	if exemplar cardinality is less than SPLIT_SIZE just use the single lattice
	otherwise:
		choose boundaries to split exemplars on
		fill sublattices
		combine sublattices to get final numbers
		
how to fill a sublattice:
	same as lattice, but no Supracontexts will be considered heterogeneous
	can't tell heterogeneity until final combination
sublattice structure:
	same as lattice, but we don't
how to combine two lattices:
