Item:
   	array of features; input as string, convert to ints
   	converted to ints for quicker comparison
   	getLabel(testItem): return binary label given a test item.
	outcome: also store as int
	occurences: number of supracontexts containing the item

Label:
	will be an n-bit number, where n is the length of the feature vectors;
	Xuse Label class, which uses:
	X	Long if number of features is Long.SIZE or less (should be always)
	X	Java.util.BitSet otherwise
	use an int
		max of 32 featrues- too big for AM anyways.
	determines the context of the subcontext, where the label of the compared context (the data
	item) is an n-bit BitSet of all 1's. A one means it matches the data item, a zero means it
	does not.

supracontextual lattice: elements are supracontexts
  lattice[2^n]
  
supracontext:
	label, ?
	heterogeneous if:
		contains 2 or more subcontexts, and
		data items in these subcontexts have different outcomes
	otherwise homogeneous
	items: number of items contained in the supracontext
	
map: break supracontextual lattice into several smaller lattices

Classifier
	AM works like this:
	list out supracontexts and their subcontexts
	determine which supracontexts are heterogenous
	count pointers within those
	assign probabilities to each outcome depending on how many pointers point to a data item with
		that outcome.
		
	Algorithm:
	create lattice. 
		Just a long list of 2^n binary labels.
		Generate using gray code.
		Each is called a supracontext.
		 n = feature length.
	Using a test item, assign supracontextual labels to each data item.
		0 means same, 1 means different.
		data items are called subcontexts.
	Place the item in all subsets of its supracontextual label.
		Use gray codes
	List homogeneous contexts
		hetereogeneous if contains 2+ outcomes in its subcontexts
		otherwise homogeneous
	Data items in homogeneous contexts are the analogical set.
	Calculate number of pointers for each item
		sum of number of items in all homogeneous supracontexts containing the item
	use numbers to predict outcome and determine analogical effect of item.
