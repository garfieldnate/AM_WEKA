Next:
	- getMasks() must account for ignored attributes, but that probably means it shouldn't be static; this will take some redesigning.
Later TODO:
- Labeler won't work if the class attribute isn't the last one.
- the fact that Subcontexts are given integer indices is leaked and should be fixed. 
	- could pass around Sublist objects instead
- factor out common test code
	- mainly the reading of the chapter3 test files
- change AM_double_format to a formatter method in Utils
- change \n's everywhere to System.getProperty("line.separator")
- mask could be done with left and right shift, instead of right shift and &
- test everything!
- toString method for Lattice
- better toString method for Supracontext, or a list of Supracontexts
- get rid of Exemplar, which does nothing
- use BitSets for unlimited-size labels
- use BigIntegers for scoring
- remove Eclipse stuff and use Gradle
- make sure the Weka jar isn't in Git 

Engineering Tasks
- Finish parallel implementation

Thoughts:
- is there a connection between k-d trees and AM's splitting into sub contexts?

Weka is annoying because:
	- Instances aren't sortable
	- doubles and integers are both used for indexing
