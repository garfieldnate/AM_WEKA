Next:

Later TODO:
- test the distributed implementation classes
- refactor supracontext a little so that it does more of its own work
- add high-level algorithm explanations for the lattice, etc.
- test complete classification with ignored unknowns
- make Supracontexts have sorted subs so that quicker merging and equality testing can be performed.
- the fact that Subcontexts are given integer indices is leaked and should be fixed. 
	- could pass around Sublist objects instead
- change AM_double_format to a formatter method in Utils
- change \n's everywhere to System.getProperty("line.separator")
- mask could be done with left and right shift, instead of right shift and &
	- could eliminate need to store an extra variable
- use BitSets for unlimited-size labels
- use BigIntegers for scoring
- remove Eclipse stuff and use Gradle
- make sure the Weka jar isn't in Git
- what would it take to make AM more of an updateable classifier, making changes to the lattice as more data is recieved.

Engineering Tasks
- Finish parallel implementation

Thoughts:
- is there a connection between k-d trees and AM's splitting into sub contexts?
