Next:
- fix output test (in progress)
- Implement ignoring unknowns in the test item. Check that that's how it's done in the Perl version.

Later TODO:
- change AM_double_format to a formatter method in Utils
- change \n's everywhere to System.getProperty("line.separator")
- fix broken tests
- test everything!
- toString method for Lattice
- get rid of Exemplar, which does nothing
- use BitSets for unlimited-size labels
- use BigIntegers for scoring
- remove Eclipse stuff and use Gradle
- make sure the Weka jar isn't in Git 

Engineering Tasks
- Finish parallel implementation

Thoughts:
- is there a connection between k-d trees and AM's splitting into sub contexts?

Weka is annoying because:
	- Instances aren't sortable
	- doubles and integers are both used for indexing
