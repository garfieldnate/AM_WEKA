Next:
- Fix incorrect classification, to complete refactor to removing Exemplar
- finish labeler testing.

Later TODO:
- Implement ignoring unknowns in the test item. Check that that's how it's done in the Perl version.
- test everything!
- toString method for Lattice
- get rid of Exemplar, which does nothing
- use BitSets for unlimited-size labels
- use BigIntegers for scoring
- remove Eclipse stuff and use Gradle
- make sure the Weka jar isn't in Git 

Engineering Tasks
- Finish parallel implementation

Thoughts:
- is there a connection between k-d trees and AM's splitting into sub contexts?
