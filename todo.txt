Later TODO:
- use a linkedhashmap instead of having supras store pointers
	- this would be a lattice, and the current lattice would be a lattice filler
- test specifically the case where there is a tie for class outcome
- clean up tests; give them better names, etc. Use Hamcrest matches to make it all more legible.
- possibly create another class like Supracontext except it doesn't track heterogeneity; for use in the distributed implementation. This would save a little bit of time and might make it clearer that there is no outcome for a partial supracontext.
- test the SupracontextCombiner class.
- add high-level algorithm explanations for the lattice, etc.
	- package-info.java?
- parallelize creation and combination of hetero lattices
- make splitting smarter so that the lattice array can't get too big
	- if we want each lattice to be cardinality 4, then divide by 4 and that's the number of Hetero's to make.

Engineering Tasks
- profile with big data sets

Thoughts:
- is there a connection between k-d trees and AM's splitting into sub contexts?
- what would it take to make AM more of an updateable classifier, making changes to the lattice as more data is recieved?
