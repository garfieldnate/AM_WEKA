Next: Write PartialSupra tests and rewrite ClassifiedSupra tests 
	- so that no extra main code is required
	- maybe write a help for creating them from sub sets?
	- don't forget supra-combining tests
Later TODO:
- change "outcome" to "class" everywhere
- parallelize combination of hetero lattices
- test specifically the case where there is a tie for class outcome
- clean up tests; give them better names, etc. Use Hamcrest matches to make it all more legible.
- add high-level algorithm explanations for the lattice, etc.
	- package-info.java?

Engineering Tasks
- get it working with big data sets
	- soybean is too big!

Thoughts:
- is there a connection between k-d trees and AM's splitting into sub contexts?
- what would it take to make AM more of an updateable classifier, making changes to the lattice as more data is recieved?
