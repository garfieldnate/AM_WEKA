Next:

Later TODO:
- unit-test the distributed implementation classes
- refactor supracontext a little so that it does more of its own work
- add high-level algorithm explanations for the lattice, etc.
	- package-info.java?
- test complete classification with ignored unknowns
- use BitSets for unlimited-size labels
	- or perhaps give multiple implementations: short, int, long, bitset
- use BigIntegers for scoring

Engineering Tasks
- profile with big data sets

Thoughts:
- is there a connection between k-d trees and AM's splitting into sub contexts?
- what would it take to make AM more of an updateable classifier, making changes to the lattice as more data is recieved.
